<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a curious learner, always seeking new things to learn and draw inspiration from. 
  I love talking to people, especially during my solo travels, as it allows me to connect with different cultures and gain unique perspectives. 
  When it comes to creating and designing, I approach it from a logical standpoint, focusing on crafting projects that are both practical and creative. 
  Whether I’m working on a new design, exploring a new hobby, or simply learning from the world around me, I’m constantly driven by a desire to grow and discover more! 
  I’d love to connect and share ideas, so feel free to reach out – let’s inspire and learn from each other! <br/>
